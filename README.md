# LLM-MRI: a brain scanner for LLMs

As the everyday use of large language models (LLMs) grows, so does the necessity of understanding how LLMs achieve their designed outputs.

One approach to analyzing LLM interpretability is to examine the neuron activations produced by the model for each different label. Accordingly, the objective of this library is to contribute to LLM interpretability research. LLM-MRI allows users to explore various types of activation visualization methods to ensure the model's interpretability.

We encourage you to not only use this toolkit but also to extend it as you see fit.
